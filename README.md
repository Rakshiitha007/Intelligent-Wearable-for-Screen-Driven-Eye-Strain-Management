# Intelligent-Wearable-for-Screen-Driven-Eye-Strain-Management
Our project aims to create a wearable fatigue management system that detects eye strain and provides real-time alerts using an IR blink sensor, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a vibrator. The system is designed to enhance safety and productivity by providing real-time fatigue alerts.
